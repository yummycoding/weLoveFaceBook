## About MEAN Stack

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - MongoDB is the leading NoSQL database, empowering businesses to be more agile and scalable
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications
- [Angular 4](https://angular.io/) - based framework. -Angular lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop
- [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/) - Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications

#### Source code
To install our source code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yummycoding/weLoveFaceBook
cd weLoveFaceBook
npm install
```

## Mount Program
After setting up the environment needed and installing our source code, now you can mount Gatorbook server and use the app on your own end!

To mount Gatorbook server:

- In your terminal, key in `mongod`. This will open your database.

- Then open a new terminal and change your working directory to folder "frontend", and key in `ng build -w`. This will build dist for your front end. 

- At last open another terminal and change your working directory to folder "backend", key in `nodemon server.js`, which use the dist built in step 2, and mount the server on https://localhost:3000.

Enjoy using Gatorbook:

- In your browser, view https://localhost:3000 and you are now able to use our application on your own computer!

## Testing
For testing, we did unit testing for both front and back end when developing, also e2e testing were done to make sure project works as a whole.
